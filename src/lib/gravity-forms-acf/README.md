Gravity-Forms-ACF-Field
=======================

This is an Advanced Custom Field custom field to select one or many [Gravity Forms](http://www.gravityhelp.com/).

This provides a field that lets you select from a list of active Gravity Forms.


Installation
============

Download or clone the repository for Gravity-Forms-ACF-Field and put the gravity_forms.php in your theme somewhere.  We like to create a Custom-Fields sub-directory to keep things tidy.

Register the field in your functions.php file

if(function_exists('register_field')) { 
  register_field(â€˜Gravity_Forms_field', dirname(__File__) . '/Custom-Fields/gravity_forms.php');
}

Using the field
===============

The field lets you pick one or many fields.

The data returned is either a Form object or an array of [Form objects](http://www.gravityhelp.com/documentation/page/Form_Object).
